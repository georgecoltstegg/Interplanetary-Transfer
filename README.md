# Interplanetary Transfer Evaluation
Texas A&M University 
AERO 423 Project #2

Attached inside this github repository is the MATLAB code and project report for performing an evaluation and optimization of an interplanetary transfer. Using the equations and information learned in AERO 423 at Texas A&M University taught by Dr. Terry Alfriend, we are able to come up with the resulting 3-D contour plot for every possible combination of true anomaly and altitude within a given range of values to see which requires the most delta V.
